# Communication-System-Simulation
Simulation of communication system in MATLAB


The objective of this project was to simulate a communication system and use it to analyze and estimation error probability (number of bit-errors and word-errors of a message/message sent through the communication channel)

Encoding and decoding algorithmes used in this project:
1. Self made encoder/decoder
2. Hamming encoder/decoder
3. BCH encoder/decoder
